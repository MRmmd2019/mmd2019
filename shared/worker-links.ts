/**
 * How each deployed worker source serves its subscription links.
 *
 * The client buttons in the panel must send the `target=` name the *source*
 * itself understands. A value the worker does not match does not fall back to a
 * usable config — the request ends in the worker's raw branch (or in nothing),
 * so the client imports a broken profile. Two things were wrong that way:
 * `v2rayng` (the source matches `v2ray`) and a `shadowrocket` target the sources
 * do not implement at all — Shadowrocket reads the plain (base64) sub, so its
 * button must point at the raw link.
 *
 * The CFnew values below were read out of the source this repo ships
 * (`public/repo/worker-source.js`, also bundled as `nexus.js`): its sub handler
 * does `searchParams.get('target') || 'base64'`, lower-cases it, and matches it
 * against `clash | clashr | surge | surge2 | surge3 | surge4 | quantumult |
 * quanx | ss | ssr | v2ray | loon | singbox`. edgetunnel (cmliu) is the upstream
 * of that same target scheme; the zeus-style full panels (zeus, miliconfigzeus,
 * nova) issue a subscription per user inside their own dashboard and have no
 * deploy-time sub link at all.
